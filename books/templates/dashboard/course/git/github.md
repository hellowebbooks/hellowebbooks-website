If you’ve heard of Git, then you’ve probably heard of GitHub ([https://github.com](https://github.com))! Quick overview (as this is mostly beyond the scope of this guide): GitHub can host your project and project history remotely so you have a backup of everything. It would suck to start working on a project and have something happen to your computer and lose your coding work.

This also makes it useful to share your projects with others, as you can “push” to GitHub (make a copy of all your project files on GitHub) and they can “pull” those files onto their own machine.

GitHub also gives you a nicer interface to view your project history, inspect the branches, see what changes were made where, when, and by whom.

If you’d like to use a tool like this (I recommend it), you can use GitHub or its competitor, GitLab ([https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)). Both give you the option of putting your code in a public or private repository. If you don’t care if people can see your code and you don’t have any things that you don’t want to be public (like secret keys), then a public repo is just fine, but always use a private repo if you have anything you don’t want public.

It’s fairly easy to link your Git repos with places like GitHub. Check out this great guide for GitHub: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git).
