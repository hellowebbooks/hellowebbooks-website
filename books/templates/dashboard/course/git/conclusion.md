Yay, we can program with confidence that our work is backed up and history is saved!

There is *so much more* to Git, but this is 99% of what you’ll be doing most of the time. It’s a very powerful system that’s used in a lot of different ways.

In general though, the average person just tracks their project history, commits their progress, and shares that history with a remote repository like GitLab or GitHub. Easy peasy.

I hope this was a fun introduction for you! Feel free to ask any questions you have on the Hello Web App discussion forum: https://discuss.hellowebapp.com

If you’re looking for the next step, I invite you to check out Hello Web App, my book and course teaching web app development with Django. Even if you’re new to programming and the command line, the book is pretty easy to just follow along, try things out, and learn more by doing.

Thanks friends, and good luck on your programming journey!
