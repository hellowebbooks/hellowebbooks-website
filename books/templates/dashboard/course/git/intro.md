Are you new to programming? Have you wondered, "Git? What’s that?"

(Personally, I grew up in a rural area and "Git" is usually accompanied with
“...the heck outta here, you varmint!”)

I’m a designer who taught myself how to code and it changed my life. One of the
important parts of learning to code was figuring out how to use Git, a version control system for code. Or, in plainer terms, a system to save your coding history so you can back it up, or go back in time to earlier versions, or share with others. It’s one of the most useful and most recommended things to learn and use while you’re writing programs.

This guide covers the basic commands that you’ll be using most of the time. Git itself is a *very* powerful system so we’re not going to go into all the advanced things you can do with it (and things you won’t need or want to learn until much later).

If you’re interested in my other free guides on getting started with programming, check out the [Really Friendly Command Line Intro](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/) too! Same concept and format as this guide.

Last but not least, this booklet was originally created as an addition to *Hello Web App*, my video course and book teaching beginner web app development using Python and Django. Want to learn how to build a web app, maybe an Instagram clone or your own blog system? Check out Hello Web App: [https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django).

Let’s get started!
