In 2010 I taught myself how to code, and my world just *opened up.* I went from only using what other people built for the computer, to being able to build my own computer widgets and products and even a full-fledged startup. I love being able to code and feel like I can *speak* to computers to tell them what to do.

And, for the learn-to-code journey, learning the "command line" is the first step. It’s a really scary step — no helpful graphics or buttons, just a blank space where you can type in commands, and who knows what’s going on in the background?

BUT. When you learn *just enough* to work with the command line, which means you can start working with programming languages like Python, believe me: It’s not as scary as it might seem.

## What is the command line?

We’re used to having programs for everything we want to do on the computer. For example, our Finder window, where we can navigate our hard drive, create new files and folders, delete files, and navigate every file we have stored in our system.

We can do the same thing in the command line — navigate our system, see our files, update or change our files — we just won’t have a graphical interface (graphical means shiny buttons and dropdowns) on top of what we’re doing, and instead of clicking, we have to type out what we want.

And yeah, that sucks, we got to remember what to type and what commands we can use. No worries, you don’t need to memorize everything! This booklet will teach the easy basics (with a cheat sheet at the end) and you can slowly pick up other commands as you need them during your programming journey.

## What is Unix?

You might see other guides teaching the command line mentioning "Unix" a lot. Unix is, essentially, a family of operating systems, which Mac and Linux are a part of. A lot of guides call the command line, the “Unix command line,” because Mac, Linux, and other computers share the same set of commands to talk to their computer (so hey, everything you learn here can be used if you ever use Linux!)

The exception is Windows, who decided to do their own slightly different thing. Thankfully, for Windows users, there are a lot of utilities out there that allow you to use the Unix commands on a Windows computer. By and large, programming tutorials and tools assume that you can use Unix commands, so Windows users install additional utilities on the computer.

I’m not going to mention Unix from here on out, but just wanted to give you a heads-up in case you get confused by other tutorials!

## How is this tutorial different?

I am going to gloss over most technical details and summarize things into understandable, dumbed-down, explanations. Not saying that you’re dumb! A lot of other tutorials get into the mindset of, "Well let’s explain *everything* that is going on! The *full, complete, detailed, confusing* explanation so you know *exactly* how things work!"

If you’re like me, your mind start glazing over when an explanation gets way too wordy. I don’t want to do that here. And to those who might be reading this guide and thinking, "Well, that’s not *technically exactly* correct…" — I’m not going for technically exactly. I’m going for *just enough* so you (dear reader) feel comfortable jumping in.
