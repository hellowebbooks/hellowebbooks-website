This whole time I’ve been having you type everything out (sorry!) There are some nifty autocomplete and other tools you can use to save yourself time when typing commands (or, even better than saving time, preventing typos by using autocomplete.)

## Tab to autocomplete

When you’re typing a command that involves a file in your current directory (like moving a file from your current directory into another), the command line can auto-complete your file name.

Try it out for moving a file with `mv`. Remember, the full command is `mv FILENAME WHERETOMOVE` and both of those bits after mv can be autocompleted.

If it doesn’t autocomplete (and makes that sad "*doot*" default sound if you
have your speakers on), it means that autocomplete doesn't see any filenames
that start with the letters you've typed so far, so it couldn’t find the file or
the location you were specified.

This is super handy when you’re working with files with long names! After you work with it a bit, tabbing to autocomplete your command line commands will become second nature.

(Note: Maybe you typed one character and pressed tab to autocomplete it, and you just get an another "*doot*" from your computer and no autocompletion. That usually means there are multiple files that match what you’re autocompleting, so you need to type a bit more until you have enough characters that autocomplete can find the exact file you’re looking for!)

## Pressing up to access previous commands

If you find yourself typing the same command into the command line over and over (perhaps, down the road, you’re running a script you wrote over and over), you can press "up" in the command line to access your previous commands! Hit “enter” after you’ve found the command you’d like to rerun and it’ll execute. Pretty handy time saver.
