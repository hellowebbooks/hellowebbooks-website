## Wow, this is a lot!

Right? The command line is a* really* powerful tool. We just skimmed the surface of what you can do, but hopefully covered *just enough* so you feel comfortable poking around and learning a bit more.

With the command line, you’re speaking directly to your computer — no need for a graphical user -interface to translate for you. And as you go through and learn programming, you’ll find out how much you can do from one little window.

I hope this was a fun introduction for you! Feel free to ask any questions you have on the *Hello Web App* discussion forum: [https://discuss.hellowebapp.com](https://discuss.hellowebapp.com)

If you’re looking for the next step, I invite you to check out *Hello Web App,* my book and course teaching web app development with Django. Even if you’re new to programming and the command line, the book is pretty easy to just follow along, try things out, and learn more by doing. Check it out here: [https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django)

Thanks friends, and good luck on your programming journey!
