        <h2><strong><span class="highlight">All Books</span></strong></h2>

        <dt>
            How much is shipping for the physical books?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            If you're in the US, shipping is $3.22. If you're in Canada, shipping is around $10 USD extra. If you're elsewhere, shipping is $14-30 USD extra.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Why is shipping so expensive?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I hear you, Australia + Asia customers. It really sucks that I can't send the books for less than $25 USD thataway. I'm looking into some way of shipping books en mass to another distribution center but unfortunately that isn't ready yet.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            What is the shipping speed?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            US and Canada shipments should arrive in less than a week, and the rest of the world should arrive within two weeks. Unfortunately, I don't get tracking numbers for overseas shipments.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            How do I access the files I bought?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            You'll receive access to a dashboard where you can download your files (PDF, ePub, and .mobi versions), and you'll be able to read the book online as well. If videos are a part of your package, then you can access the videos on your dashboard as well.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            I bought from a different website (e.g. Amazon.) Can I get access to the customer dashboard?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Sure! Send me an email <a href="mailto:tracy@hellowebbooks.com">tracy@hellowebbooks.com</a> and we can work something out.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Where should I buy to give you the most amount of profit?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <strong>Buy from this website!</strong> Avoid Amazon (but please leave me a review there!)</strong>
        </dd>

        <h2><strong><span class="highlight">Hello Web App</span></strong></h2>
        <dt>
            What version of Python and Django is Hello Web App written for?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <strong>Hello Web App is written with Python 3.4 and Django 2.2.</strong> The digital books will be periodically updated as Django updates, but I will be unable to swap paperback books out for new versions when they come out.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            What level of programming experience do I need? What about HTML and CSS?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <strong>Hello Web App assumes you have no previous programming knowledge.</strong> But it's best if you know a bit about HTML markup — since the book starts out building a website and setting up static files, things will fit a lot faster if you know a bit about website creation. That said, if you like to learn-by-doing, feel free to walk through the tutorial verbatim and you'll learn some HTML as you go.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            What do you build in the tutorial?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <strong>We're building a "collection of things."</strong> That sounds generic, but you can alter the generic examples ("Thing") to something that fits this metric (like building a directory of web designers, so your "Thing" will be a "Profile.") A lot of different ideas fit this — for example, Twitter is a collection of small paragraphs. Pinterest is a collection of photos. Facebook used to be a collection of personal data.

            I highly encourage you to build something unique to you, because what you'll learn will stick better!
        </dd>

        <h2><strong><span class="highlight">Hello Web Design</span></strong></h2>
        <dt>
            Will I learn HTML?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <strong>Hello Web Design covers only visual, user-experience, and user-interface design</strong> &#8212; no front-end development. So, no HTML, CSS, Javascript, or any other sort of code.
